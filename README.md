# gasorinejoki-pertalite

The purpose of making this gasoline steam technology is to produce a more cost-effective alternative to LPG. In addition, gasoline steam technology comes from materials that are easy to find and very easy to apply by all people. We have made this project for Lomba Karya Teknologi Tepat Guna that held by Dinas Pemberdayaan Masyarakat dan Desa, Pemberdayaan Perempuan dan Perlindungan Anak, Keluarga Berencana Kabupaten Sidoarjo where we came up as 1st place winner and Online Science Project Competition (OSPC) 2019 that held by Indonesian Young Scientist Association where we came up as bronze medalist.
